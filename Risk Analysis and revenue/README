Business Postpaid Mobile Accounts Risk Analysis and Revenue Opportunities (2020-2021)
This project focuses on analyzing business postpaid mobile accounts to evaluate credit risk, activation rates, and identify revenue opportunities based on data from 2020 to 2021
. Using Python, Pandas, and visualization tools, the analysis delves into customer activation behavior, credit scores, and account performance across various
demographics and business channels.

The main objectives of the project are to analyze overall and monthly activation rates, examine how activation rates vary by customer demographics such as
age group, province, and channel type, and evaluate the distribution of credit risk and its relationship to account activation. The data used includes
business postpaid mobile applications, credit information for each customer, and target activation rates set by the business for 2020 and 2021.

Key findings include an overall activation rate of 70.06%, with significant variations in activation rates by age group, province, and channel type.
Additionally, most customers were classified in the "B" credit class, with a median credit score of 741.

The project utilizes Python and Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. To reproduce the analysis, 
clone the repository, install Python and the required libraries, download the dataset, and run the provided Python script or Jupyter notebook.

This analysis helps identify factors influencing customer activation and credit risk, offering valuable insights for business decision-making regarding
postpaid mobile accounts.
